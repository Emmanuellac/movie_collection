This project and the data used was part of a case study which can be found here. It focuses on examining dates, series, and factors influencing movie productions in order to gain insights into their, production maangement, total revenue spent and earned from a movie/series and potential areas for improvement in movie directing or marketing strategies in a dining establishment.

Background
this is a collection of movies from 1927-2019 from different director and stars,with the aim of making movie production versatile and good quality viewing for people.

Problem Statement
I want to use the data to answer a few simple questions about movies, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which movies are peoples favorite. Having this deeper connection with directors and stars will help  deliver a better and more personalized experience for views.
I plans on using these insights to help Directors decide whether we should expand our movie production yearly or monthly loyalty,additionally it will help to generate some basic datasets so to document and keep record of movies without needing to use SQL.
i have been provided with a sample of overall movies with date,directors,runtimes,no of votes and money made.data due to privacy issues - we hope that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
